# Analytical_projects

This repository contains projects I work on to practice the data analysis skills and just out of curiosity.

I mainly plan to practice Python packages for data analysis (Pandas, Numpy), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), web parsing (Beatiful soup), and machine learning (scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost).

| Project name | Description | Libraries | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Mobile game economy analysis](game_economy_analysis) | Analysis of the players resource mining logs of a mobile game. Using this data I estimated the relative cost of the resources in the game| *pandas, numpy, scipy, statistics, matplotlib, seaborn*
| [Google trends search analysis](google_trends_ukraine_search) | Using pytrends package I fetch Google Trends data on the "Ukraine" searchword. Studied the popularity of the word analysis by region and time. Decomposed the data to reveal weekly seasonality to the search popularity| *pandas, statsmodels, pytrends, matplotlib, seaborn*
| [Data Analysts salary analysis in Saint Petersburg](hh.ru_salary_analysis) | Scraped job data from hh.ru using beatiful soup. Analyzed the data, calculated basic statistics for the salary data and visualized the findings| *pandas, BeautifulSoup, requests, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib*
