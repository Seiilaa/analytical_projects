# Analytical_projects

This repository contains projects I work on to practice the data analysis skills and just out of curiosity.

I mainly plan to practice Python packages for data analysis (Pandas, Numpy), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), web parsing (Beatiful soup), and machine learning (scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost).
